# Really Simple HTTP Server

Really simple HTTP server for serving static files.
I created this because python's http.server can not serve javascript module file properly.
> Failed to load module script: The server responded with a non-JavaScript MIME type of "text/plain". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.
